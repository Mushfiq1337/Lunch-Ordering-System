The interface follows the following design principles:
1.	Visibility: The interface is designed to be intuitive and self-explanatory. The labels clearly describe the purpose of each field, and the form is presented in a logical order, with the most important fields (name and email) at the top.
 
2.	Feedback: The form provides feedback to the user in real-time as they fill in each field. When a required field is left blank, the browser will display an error message.
 
3.	Constraints: The form has constraints that help prevent invalid input. For example, the email field requires a valid email address format, and the user cannot submit the form without filling in all required fields.
4.	Consistency: The form is consistent with other forms on the website in terms of layout, styling, and behavior. This ensures that the user experience is seamless and predictable across the site.
5.	Affordance: The form elements are designed to look and behave in a way that suggests their purpose. For example, the submit button is styled to look like a button, and the select menu is styled to look like a dropdown menu.
